"q1","An intervention occurs at a specific point in time. The researcher wants to compare the outcomes of the affected (treatment) group and the unaffected (control) group. Before the intervention, the growth rate of the treatment group is significantly lower than that of the control group. Can we use the Diff-in-Diff model to make causal inferences based on this scenario?","Yes, we can use it","No, we cannot use it",NA,"choice_2","Correct! The Parallel Trends Assumption is violated here, as the pre-intervention trends of the treatment and control groups are different. This makes it impossible to attribute post-intervention differences solely to the intervention.","Incorrect. The correct answer is 'No'. Since the pre-intervention trends are different, the Parallel Trends Assumption is violated, which invalidates the use of Diff-in-Diff for causal inference."
"q2","What is the primary purpose of the Parallel Trends Assumption in a Diff-in-Diff model?","To ensure that the treatment group and control group have the same trend before the intervention","To ensure that the treatment group and control group have the same outcome after the intervention","To control for confounding variables","choice_1","Correct! The Parallel Trends Assumption ensures that any difference after the intervention can be attributed to the treatment effect.","Incorrect. The correct answer is 'A'. The Parallel Trends Assumption ensures that both groups would have similar trends if the intervention did not occur."
"q3","What does it imply if the treatment group and control group do not have similar trends before the intervention?","The Parallel Trends Assumption is violated","The intervention has no effect","The groups are perfectly matched","choice_1","Correct! If the trends are not similar before the intervention, the Parallel Trends Assumption is violated, which means the Diff-in-Diff model may not provide valid causal estimates.","Incorrect. The correct answer is 'A'. If the treatment and control groups do not have similar trends before the intervention, it means the Parallel Trends Assumption is violated."
"q4","What does the Exchangeability Assumption imply in a Diff-in-Diff model?","There are no systematic differences between the treatment and control groups","The control group should become the treatment group after the intervention","The intervention must be randomly assigned","choice_1","Correct! The Exchangeability Assumption implies that there are no systematic differences between the treatment and control groups, ensuring that any observed differences in outcomes can be attributed to the intervention.","Incorrect. The correct answer is 'A'. When the Exchangeability Assumption holds, there are no systematic differences between the groups, which prevents bias in estimating the intervention's effect. If there are systematic differences, a confounding factor may explain the outcome differences, leading to bias in the Diff-in-Diff model."
"q5","What is the expected outcome if the Exchangeability Assumption is violated in a Diff-in-Diff analysis?","The model will be biased due to confounding factors","The results are unaffected","The treatment effect will always be overestimated","choice_1","Correct! Violating the Exchangeability Assumption means there are systematic differences between the groups, likely due to confounding factors, which introduces bias into the estimated treatment effect.","Incorrect. The correct answer is 'A'. When the Exchangeability Assumption is violated, confounding factors can influence the outcome, leading to bias in the estimated treatment effect."
